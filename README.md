# Colour Generator
This webpage is a random background colour changer
This was a good project to start working with the DOM.

In Leonardo Maldonado's article on why it is important to learn about the DOM, he states:

By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.

Key concepts covered:
- arrays
- document.getElementById()
- document.querySelector()
- addEventListener()
- document.body.style.backgroundColor
- Math.floor()
- Math.random()
- array.length
